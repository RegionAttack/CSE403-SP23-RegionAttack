# CSE403-SP23-RegionAttack
<h2>Idea<h2>
<p>Region Attack is a math-based, strategic two-player game. The goal of the game is to cover a larger connected region than your opponent. These regions are built by placing numbers, which are generated randomly, from the player’s pool numbers. Numbers can be placed next to either multiples or divisors. Primes can additionally be placed anywhere in the player’s half, as long as the multiple/divisor rule is not violated. One can overwrite the opponent's numbers by placing larger numbers on top and one can overwrite your own numbers while obeying the placing rules. When one player completely encloses a region all the opponent’s numbers are removed from the inside. The game ends after a certain amount of time, after which the player with the largest enclosed region wins.

<h2>Vision<h2>
<p>The game can teach kids basic mathematical concepts in a playful manner, as well as keep the minds of seniors minds active. We believe that training logical and mathematical skills is useful in many areas and this game can be a useful tool to train these skills. We plan to develop the game in predefined steps: a two-player version on one phone, one player against the computer version, and online matching of players.<p>
