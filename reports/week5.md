# Weekly Status Report - Region Attack: Week 4

## Team Report

### Project Meeting Agenda

* Quickly report on progress
* Discuss how to improve on working with deadlines
* Discuss and assign tasks for Testing deliverable
* Backend report & walk through code (probably not that important for Apollo)

### Plans from Last week

* Overall goal: Implement the 1 vs. 1 local game mode base functionality in FE and BE (does not need to fully work yet)
* [Leander] Set up basic backend functionalities and provide an interface for front-end
* [Kaede] Implement game board including basic functionality like placement of numbers
* [Sri] Research task on how to implement multiplayer online version(specifically using i database) & documentation in the DnA section
* [Yanick] Assign tasks for DnA deliverable and ensure submission
* [Yanick] Implement home screen

### Progress & Issues

#### Progress

* Overall progress: 1 vs. 1 local game mod base functionality is implemented in FE and Logic Layer
* [Kaede] FE - Gameboard and basic functionality
* [Kaede] Bug - Expected Revision Gitignore
* [Kaede] DnA - Software architecture & Software Design deliverable
* [Yanick] PM - Complete git deliverable
* [Yanick] PM - Submit weekly status report
* [Yanick] PM - DnA - Coding Guidelines, Process description, and Setup of Rest
* [Yanick] PM - Finalize tasks for next week
* [Yanick] Bug - Optional Revision => Documentation in external requirements
* [Sri] BE - Research online mode implementation, talked with UW CSE server staff about possibilities regarding using attu as a server. The problem with attu as a server is that it would require giving all users a common log in(ex. my username/pwd) to attu which is bad. The other option is possibly setting up a specific computer with a static IP. This is temporary but possible.
* [Sri] DnA - Software architecture & Software Design deliverable
* [Leander] BE - Set up basic functionality
* [Leander] BE - Set up basic computer player
* [Leander] DnA - Design and Architecture deliverable

#### Issues
* Overall issues: Working with deadlines.
* [Kaede] Dealing with potential screen size changes when playing on PC. Will focus on adjusting to mobile settings (assuming a vertical screen) and then get to displaying for horizontal screens.
* [Yanick] Working with the deadlines and in the end there was quite a lot to organize to meet the last weeks deliverable and to discuss regarding that in the meetings that I didn't get to talk with Kaede about FE implementation and couldnâ€™t start my FE task as a result
* [Sri] Talked with server team, there was some delay in communication(done over email), there is some possibility with setting up a computer with a static IP, like for a week(fixed period of time).
* [Leander] Dealing with bugs in the main game functionality that need to be dealt with. I will try to use tests to ensure that there are no more major bugs/issues left in the functionality.
